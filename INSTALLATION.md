# A/B Price Testing App - Installation Guide

## Overview
This app allows you to run A/B tests on product prices in your Shopify store. Customers will see different prices based on the traffic distribution you configure (e.g., 34% see original price, 33% see Test Variant 1, 33% see Test Variant 2).

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install the App Extension
The app includes a Shopify theme extension that needs to be installed in your store:

1. In your Shopify admin, go to **Online Store > Themes**
2. Click **Actions > Edit code** on your active theme
3. In the **Sections** folder, create a new file called `price-test.liquid`
4. Copy the contents from `extensions/price-test-app-extension/price-test.liquid` into this file
5. Save the file

### 2. Add the Extension to Your Product Template
1. In the theme editor, go to **Templates > product.liquid** (or your product template)
2. Add this line near the end of the file, before the closing `</body>` tag:
   ```liquid
   {% render 'price-test' %}
   ```

### 3. Configure the Extension
1. In your theme settings, you should see a new section for "A/B Price Testing"
2. Enable the extension by setting "Enable A/B Price Testing" to `true`
3. Optionally enable "Debug Mode" to see console logs for testing

## How It Works

### Customer Experience
- When a customer visits a product page, the extension automatically checks for active A/B tests
- Based on the customer's session ID and the traffic distribution, they are assigned to see either:
  - Original price (base traffic percentage)
  - Test Variant 1 price
  - Test Variant 2 price
- The assignment is consistent - the same customer will always see the same price during their session

### Traffic Distribution
- **Base Price Traffic %**: Percentage of customers who see the original price
- **Test Variant 1 Traffic %**: Percentage who see the first test price
- **Test Variant 2 Traffic %**: Percentage who see the second test price
- Total must equal 100%

### Analytics Tracking
The app automatically tracks:
- **Views**: When customers see a price (original or test)
- **Conversions**: When customers add the product to cart
- **Revenue**: Total revenue generated by each variant

## Testing Your Setup

### 1. Create a Test
1. Go to your app dashboard
2. Click "Create Test"
3. Select "Single Product Test"
4. Choose a product
5. Set traffic distribution (e.g., 34% base, 33% variant 1, 33% variant 2)
6. Set test prices
7. Click "Create Test"
8. Start the test

### 2. Verify Price Display
1. Open your store's product page in an incognito/private browser window
2. Refresh the page multiple times to see different prices
3. Check the browser console (F12) for debug logs if debug mode is enabled
4. You should see different prices based on your traffic distribution

### 3. Check Analytics
1. Go to the "Analytics" page in your app
2. You should see view and conversion data for each variant
3. Monitor the performance of different price points

## Troubleshooting

### Prices Not Changing
- Ensure the extension is properly installed in your theme
- Check that the test is active (status = "active")
- Verify the product ID matches between your test and the store
- Enable debug mode to see console logs

### Analytics Not Tracking
- Check that the app's API endpoints are accessible
- Verify the shop domain matches between the extension and app
- Look for JavaScript errors in the browser console

### Extension Not Loading
- Ensure the liquid file is properly saved in your theme
- Check that the template includes the extension render tag
- Verify the theme has the necessary permissions

## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Styling
You can customize the visual appearance of test prices by modifying the CSS in the extension file:
```css
.ab-test-price {
  /* Your custom styles */
}

.ab-test-indicator {
  /* Your custom styles */
}
```

### Multiple Tests
The app supports multiple active tests, but for simplicity, it uses the first active test found. To support multiple simultaneous tests, you would need to modify the assignment logic.

## Support
